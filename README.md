# Rapida: End-to-End Voice Orchestration Platform

[Rapida](https://rapida.ai) is an open-source platform for designing, building, and deploying voice agents at scale.  
It’s built around three core principles:

- **Reliable** — designed for production workloads, real-time audio, and fault-tolerant execution
- **Observable** — deep visibility into calls, latency, metrics, and tool usage
- **Customizable** — flexible architecture that adapts to any LLM, workflow, or enterprise stack

Rapida provides both a **platform** and a **framework** for building real-world voice agents—from low-latency audio streaming to orchestration, monitoring, and integrations.

Rapida is written in **Go**, using the highly optimized [gRPC](https://github.com/grpc/grpc-go) protocol for fast, efficient, bidirectional communication.

---

## Features

- **Real-time Voice Orchestration**  
  Stream and process audio with low latency using GRPC.

- **LLM-Agnostic Architecture**  
  Bring your own model—OpenAI, Anthropic, open-source models, or custom inference.

- **Production-grade Reliability**  
  Built-in retries, error handling, call lifecycle management, and health checks.

- **Full Observability**  
  Call logs, streaming events, tool traces, latency breakdowns, metrics, and dashboards.

- **Flexible Tooling System**  
  Build custom tools and actions for your agents, or integrate with any backend.

- **Developer-friendly**  
  Clear APIs, modular components, and simple configuration.

- **Enterprise-ready**  
  Scalable design, efficient protocol, and predictable performance.

## Documentation & Guides

https://doc.rapida.ai

## Prerequisites

- **Docker** & **Docker Compose** ([Install](https://www.docker.com/))
- **16GB+ RAM** (for all services)

---

## Quick Start

Get all services running in 4 commands:

```bash
# Clone repo
git clone https://github.com/rapidaai/voice-ai.git && cd voice-ai

# Setup & build
make setup-local && make build-all

# Start all services
make up-all

# View running services
docker compose ps
```

**Services Ready:**

- UI: http://localhost:3000
- Web API: http://localhost:9001
- Assistant API: http://localhost:9007
- Endpoint API: http://localhost:9005
- Integration API: http://localhost:9004
- Document API: http://localhost:9010

**Stop services:**

```bash
make down-all
```

---

## Development

### Work on Specific Services

```bash
# Start only database
make up-db

# Start only UI
make up-ui

# Start only Assistant API
make up-assistant

# List all start commands
make help
```

### View Logs

```bash
# All services
make logs-all

# Specific service
make logs-web
make logs-assistant
```

### Rebuild After Code Changes

```bash
# Rebuild and restart one service
make rebuild-assistant

# Rebuild all
make rebuild-all
```

### Configure Services

Edit environment files before starting:

- `docker/web-api/.web.env` - Web API (port 9001)
- `docker/assistant-api/.assistant.env` - Assistant API (port 9007)
- `docker/endpoint-api/.endpoint.env` - Endpoint API (port 9005)
- `docker/integration-api/.integration.env` - Integration API (port 9004)
- `docker/document-api/config.yaml` - Document API (port 9010)

Add your API keys (OpenAI, Anthropic, Deepgram, Twilio, etc.) in these files.

---

## Local Development (Without Docker)

### Go Services

```bash
# Install dependencies
go mod download

# Build service
go build -o bin/web ./cmd/web

# Run service
./bin/web
```

Requires PostgreSQL, Redis, OpenSearch running separately.

### React UI

```bash
cd ui

# Install & run
yarn install
yarn start:dev

# Build for production
yarn build
```

---

## Troubleshooting

**Port already in use:**

```bash
lsof -i :3000    # Find process
kill -9 <PID>    # Kill it
```

**Services won't start:**

```bash
make logs-all    # Check logs
docker compose ps  # Verify status
```

**Database issues:**

```bash
# Test connection
docker compose exec postgres psql -U rapida -d web_db -c "SELECT 1"

# Reset everything
make clean
make setup-local
make build-all
make up-all
```

---

## All Commands

```bash
make help          # Show all available commands
make setup-local   # Create data directories
make build-all     # Build all Docker images
make up-all        # Start all services
make down-all      # Stop all services
make logs-all      # View all logs
make clean         # Remove containers & volumes
make restart-all   # Restart all services
```
